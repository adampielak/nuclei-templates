  name: "Request for Quote < 1.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Request for Quote plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions before 1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the action_wpheka_add_to_quote and action_remove_item_from_rfq_list AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform restricted administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
