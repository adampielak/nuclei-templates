  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WordPress Appointment Booking and Online Scheduling Plugin by Appointy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
