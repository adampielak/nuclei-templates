info:
  name: "News Announcement Scroll <= 8.8.8 - Authenticated (Admininstrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The News Announcement Scroll plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 8.8.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
