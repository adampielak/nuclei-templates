info:
  name: >
    File Manager Pro – Filester <=  1.8 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The File Manager Pro – Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient permission controls on file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This may only be an issue on multi-site installations where users shouldn't have access to upload files.
