  description: >
    The Html5 Video Player â€“ mp4 player, Video Player for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.18 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
