id: CVE-2023-32583

info:
  name: "WP All Backup <= 2.4.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Backup Storage Modification"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WP All Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.3. This is due to missing nonce validation on the wp_all_backup_admin_init() function called via admin_init. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform multiple actions such as deleting back-ups, starting back-ups, and restoring back-ups via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
