    Bit Form â€“ Contact Form Plugin <= 2.18.0 - Open Redirect
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Contact Form by Bit Form: Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact Form, Payment Contact Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 2.18.0. This is due to insufficient validation on a redirect url. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
