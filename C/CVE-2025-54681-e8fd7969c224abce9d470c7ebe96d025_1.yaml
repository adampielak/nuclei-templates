    Connector for Gravity Forms and Google Sheets <= 1.2.4 - Open Redirect
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Connector for Gravity Forms and Google Sheets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.4. This is due to insufficient validation on the redirect url supplied via a parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
