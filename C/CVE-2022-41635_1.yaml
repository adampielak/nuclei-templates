    Advanced Shipment Tracking for WooCommerce <= 3.5.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via paginate_shipping_provider_list and filter_shipping_provider_list
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Advanced Shipment Tracking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.5.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the paginate_shipping_provider_list and filter_shipping_provider_list functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to filter visible shipping providers via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
