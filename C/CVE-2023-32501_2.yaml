info:
  name: "VikBooking Hotel Booking Engine & PMS <= 1.6.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery in multiple functions in admin/controller.php"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The VikBooking Hotel Booking Engine & PMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on multiple functions in the admin/controller.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify available rooms, payment options, and the default sort order of various fields via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
