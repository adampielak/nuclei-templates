id: CVE-2023-1373

info:
  name: "W4 Post List <= 2.4.5 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The W4 Post List plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via unescaped URLs in versions up to, and including, 2.4.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a victim into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Only victims using older browser should be impacted."
