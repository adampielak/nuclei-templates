    Waiting: One-click countdowns <= 0.6.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Waiting: One-click countdowns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 0.6.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on its AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create and delete countdowns, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
