info:
  name: >
    College publisher Import <= 0.1 - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The College publisher Import WordPress plugin through 0.1 does not check for the uploaded CSV file to import, allowing high privilege users to upload arbitrary files, such as PHP, leading to RCE. Due to the lack of CSRF check, the issue could also be exploited via a CSRF attack.
