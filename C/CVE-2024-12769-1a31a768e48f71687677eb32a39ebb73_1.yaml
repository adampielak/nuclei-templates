    The Simple Banner â€“ Easily add multiple Banners/Bars/Notifications/Announcements to the top or bottom of your website plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
