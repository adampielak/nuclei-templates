    Event Tickets with Ticket Scanner <= 2.5.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Ticket Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Event Tickets with Ticket Scanner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the executeJSON() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary tickets via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
