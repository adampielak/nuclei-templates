    NEX-Forms – Ultimate Form Builder – Contact forms and much more <= 8.8.1 - Unauthenticated Sensitive Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The NEX-Forms – Ultimate Form Builder – Contact forms and much more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.1 via file uploads due to insufficient directory listing prevention and lack of randomization of file names. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including files uploaded via a form.
