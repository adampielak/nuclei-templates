info:
  name: >
    Simple File List <= 6.1.8 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Simple File List plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion in versions up to, and including, 6.1.8. This is due to insufficient controls on files passed to a deletion function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, which can lead to a denial of service or remote code execution when the wp-config.php file is deleted.
