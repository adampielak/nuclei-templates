info:
  name: >
    CM Download Manager <= 2.8.5 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The CM Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads because it allows administrators to choose the php extension as an allowable file extension in versions up to, and including, 2.8.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
