    Contest Gallery <= 21.2.8.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Photos and Files Contest Gallery â€“ Contact Form, Upload Form, Social Share and Voting Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 21.2.8.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the prev10/prev10-admin/gallery/gallery.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
