  name: "Classified Listing <= 2.4.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via rtcl_ajax_thumbnail_delete"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Classified Listing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the rtcl_ajax_thumbnail_delete function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete the post thumbnail via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
