id: CVE-2021-4400

info:
  name: "Better Search <= 2.5.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery Bypass"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Better Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the bsearch_process_settings_import() and bsearch_process_settings_export() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to import and export settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
