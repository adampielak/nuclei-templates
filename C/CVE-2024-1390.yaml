    Paid Membership Subscriptions – Effortless Memberships, Recurring Payments & Content Restriction <= 2.11.1 - Missing Authorization via creating_pricing_table_page
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Paid Membership Subscriptions – Effortless Memberships, Recurring Payments & Content Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the creating_pricing_table_page function in all versions up to, and including, 2.11.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to create pricing tables.
