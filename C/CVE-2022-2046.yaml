info:
  name: "Directorist <= 7.2.2 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Directorist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the atbdp_download_file() AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 7.2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative privileges to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible. This only affects sites where administrator have been restricted in their uploading files capabilities."
