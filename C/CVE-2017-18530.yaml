info:
  name: "Rating by BestWebSoft < 0.2 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Rating by BestWebSoft plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to 0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'category' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser granted they can trick a victim into performing an action, such as clicking on a link."
