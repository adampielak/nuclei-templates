    Count per Day < 3.5.5 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Count per Day plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting via the 'limit' parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.5.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
