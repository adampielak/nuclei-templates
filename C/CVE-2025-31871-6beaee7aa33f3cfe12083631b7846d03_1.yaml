  name: >
    WP Clone any post type <= 3.5 - Open Redirect
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Clone any post type plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Open Redirect in all versions up to, and including, 3.5. This is due to insufficient validation on a redirect url. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to redirect users to potentially malicious sites if they can successfully trick them into performing an action.
