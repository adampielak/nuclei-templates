    WPBakery Page Builder <= 8.4.1 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Multiple Page Builder Elements
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WPBakery Page Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple Page Builder elements (Copyright Element,  Hover Box, Separator With Text, FAQ, Single Image, Custom Header, Button, Call To Action, Progress Bar, Pie Chart, Round Chart, and Line Chart) in all versions up to, and including, 8.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
