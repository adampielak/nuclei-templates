    WP Booking <= 2.4.4 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
