id: CVE-2023-2359

info:
  name: "Slider Revolution <= 6.6.12 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Slider Revolution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in versions up to, and including, 6.6.12. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. While the default settings allow only administrators to exploit this vulnerability, this privilege can be granted to users as low as author."
