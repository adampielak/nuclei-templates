  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Retain Live Chat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
