id: CVE-2018-6001

info:
  name: "Soundy Audio Playlist <= 4.6 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Soundy Audio Playlist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'soundy-audio-playlist/templates/front-end.php (war_sdy_pl_preview parameter)' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to leverage  arbitrary script code and execute via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
