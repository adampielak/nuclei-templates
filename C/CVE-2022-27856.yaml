  name: "Export All URLs <= 4.1 - Authenticated (Editor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Export All URLs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with editor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
