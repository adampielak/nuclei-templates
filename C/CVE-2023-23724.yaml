    WordPress Email Marketing Plugin – WP Email Capture <= 3.9.3 - Cross Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WordPress Email Marketing Plugin – WP Email Capture plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.9.3. This is due to missing nonce validation in the wp_email_capture_options_process() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify email captures, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
