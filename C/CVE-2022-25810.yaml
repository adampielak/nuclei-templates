info:
  name: "Transposh WordPress Translation <= 1.0.8.1 - Missing Authorization Checks"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several functions called via AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions and above to perform many administrative actions such as initiating new back-ups, modifying the plugin's settings, deleting duplicates, and more."
