  name: >
    DX Share Selection <= 1.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The DX Share Selection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.4. This is due to missing nonce protection on the dxss_admin_page() function found in the ~/dx-share-selection.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts into the page, granted they can trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
