info:
  name: "Beautiful Cookie Consent Banner <= 2.9.0 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Beautiful Cookie Consent Banner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple parameters in versions up to, and including, 2.9.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for administrator-level attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
