info:
  name: "JS Help Desk â€“ Best Help Desk & Support Plugin <= 2.7.7 - Missing Authorization via ajaxhandler to Insecure Direct Object Reference"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The JS Help Desk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access to, modification of, and deletion data due to a missing capability check on multiple functions called by the 'ajaxhandler' function in versions up to, and including, 2.7.7. Although a nonce check is present in some functions, no capabilities are checked for individual tickets, so it is possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above to use this nonce to perform actions such as accessing and modifying ticket data and deleting templates and images."
