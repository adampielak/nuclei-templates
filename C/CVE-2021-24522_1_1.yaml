info:
  name: >
    Paid Membership, User Registration, User Profile & Restrict Content Plugin â€“ ProfilePress <= 3.1.10 - Unauthenticated Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The User Registration, User Profile, Login & Membership &#8211; ProfilePress (Formerly WP User Avatar) WordPress plugin before 3.1.11's widget for tabbed login/register was not properly escaped and could be used in an XSS attack which could lead to wp-admin access. Further, the plugin in several places assigned $_POST as $_GET which meant that in some cases this could be replicated with just $_GET parameters and no need for $_POST values.
