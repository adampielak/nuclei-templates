    Curvo Theme (All Known Versions) - Cross-Site Request Forgery and Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Curvo Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the upload-handler.php file in all known versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
