  name: >
    Booster (<= 5.6.2), Booster Plus (< 6.0.0), and Booster Elite (< 6.0.0) for WooCommerce - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Booster plugins (Booster, Booster Plus, and Booster Elite) for WordPress are vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 5.6.2 (Booster), as well as versions below 6.0.0 (Plus and Elite). This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
