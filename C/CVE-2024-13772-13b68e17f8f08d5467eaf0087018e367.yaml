    Civi - Job Board & Freelance Marketplace WordPress Theme <= 2.1.4 - Authentication Bypass via Non-Randomized Password for SSO Accounts
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Civi - Job Board & Freelance Marketplace WordPress Theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.4. This is due to a lack of randomization of a password created during Single Sign-On via Google or Facebook. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the password of arbitrary Candidate-level users if the attacker knows the username assigned to the victim during account creation.
