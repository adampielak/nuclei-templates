  severity: medium
  description: >
    Several Extend Themes themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in multiple versions. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
