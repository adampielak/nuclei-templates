    Motors – Car Dealership & Classified Listings Plugin <= 1.4.66 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Wizard Set-up
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Motors – Car Dealership & Classified Listings Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on several functions in the ajax_actions.php file in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.66. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to execute several initial set-up actions.
