info:
  name: >
    WP Client Reports <= 1.0.22 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Client Reports plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.22. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_client_reports_send_email_report_from_ajax() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send email reports via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
