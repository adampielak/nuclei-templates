id: CVE-2017-14843

info:
  name: "Mojoomla School Management System (Unspecified Version) - Authenticated (Student+) SQL Injection"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Mojoomla School Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'id' parameter in unknown versions due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with student-level access to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."
