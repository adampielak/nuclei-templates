    Reviews and Rating – Google My Business <= 4.14 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Reviews and Rating – Google My Business plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on several functions in versions up to, and including, 4.14. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to modify restricted data and perform actions intended only for administrators like clearing cache, resetting reviews, and more.
