info:
  name: "User Registration <= 2.2.4  - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The User Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the profile_pic_upload function in versions up to, and including, 2.2.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access or higher, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
