  name: >
    WP OnlineSupport, Essential Plugin Popup Anything <= 2.2.1 - Cross Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP OnlineSupport, Essential Plugin Popup Anything plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the popupaoc_register_settings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's settings granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
