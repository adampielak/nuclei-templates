    NextGEN Gallery <= 3.37 - Authenticated (Admininistrator+) Arbitrary File Read and Deletion in gallery_edit
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read and Deletion in versions up to, and including, 3.37. This is due to insufficient input validation within the gallery_edit function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level privileges and above, to read and delete arbitrary files.
