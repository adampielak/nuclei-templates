  name: >
    Formsite | Embed online forms to collect orders, registrations, leads, and surveys <= 1.6 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Formsite | Embed online forms to collect orders, registrations, leads, and surveys plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
