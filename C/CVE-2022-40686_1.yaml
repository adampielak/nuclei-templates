    Creative Mail <= 1.5.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Plugin Deactivation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Creative Mail plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on settings change. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to deactivate arbitrary plugins via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
