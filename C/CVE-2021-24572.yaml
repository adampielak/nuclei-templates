info:
  name: "Accept Donations with PayPal <= 1.3.0 Cross-Site Request Forgery to Post Deletion"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Accept Donations with PayPal WordPress plugin before 1.3.1 provides a function to create donation buttons which are internally stored as posts. The deletion of a button is not CSRF protected and there is no control to check if the deleted post was a button post. As a result, an attacker could make logged in admins delete arbitrary posts"
