info:
  name: "Stockists Manager for Woocommerce <= 1.0.2.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Stockists Manager for Woocommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.2.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the stockist_settings_main() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
