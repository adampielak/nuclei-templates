    AccessPress Themes and Plugin <= Various Versions - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Plugin Deactivation/Activation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    A WordPress plugin and several WordPress themes developed by AccessPress Themes are vulnerable to unauthorized plugin deactivation and activation via the plugin_activation_callback and plugin_deactivate_callback functions called via AJAX actions that were missing capability checks and nonce validation. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to deactivate and activate arbitrary plugins. This could be used to deactivate security plugins and exploit other potential vulnerabilities.
