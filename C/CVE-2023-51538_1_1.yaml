  name: >
    Awesome Support <= 6.1.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Awesome Support plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.1.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpas_get_ticket_replies_ajax and ajax_delete_attachment functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger the retrieval of ticket replies and delete attachments via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
