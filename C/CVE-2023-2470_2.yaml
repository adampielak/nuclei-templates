id: CVE-2023-2470

info:
  name: "Add to Feedly <= 1.2.11 - Authenticated(Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via plugin settings"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Add to Feedly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 1.2.11 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."
