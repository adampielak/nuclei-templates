  name: "WoodMart <= 7.2.1 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WoodMart theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via an unknown parameter in versions up to, and including, 7.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
