    Memory Usage <= 3.98 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Limited Plugin Installation via wpmemory_install_plugin Function
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Memory Usage plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.98. This is due to missing nonce validation in the wpmemory_install_plugin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to silently install one of the several whitelisted plugins via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
