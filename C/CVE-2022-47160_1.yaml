id: CVE-2022-47160

info:
  name: >
    Wp Social <= 1.9.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Information Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Wp Social plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.9.0. This is due to missing capability checks on the 'export_users_content_csv' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions such as subscribers to export user content such as user logins and passwords of various social media providers.
