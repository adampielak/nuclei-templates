    MinimogWP – The High Converting eCommerce WordPress Theme <= 3.9.0 - Unauthenticated Price Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The MinimogWP – The High Converting eCommerce WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to price manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.0. This is due to an insufficient check on quantity values when changing quantities in the cart. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add items to the cart and adjust the quantity to a fractional amount, causing the price to change based on the fractional amount. The vulnerability cannot be exploited if WooCommerce version 9.8.2+ is installed.
