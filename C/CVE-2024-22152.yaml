  name: >
    Product Import Export for WooCommerce <= 2.3.7 - Authenticated(Shop Manager+) Arbitrary File Upload via upload_import_file
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Product Import Export for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'upload_import_file' function n all versions up to, and including, 2.3.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
