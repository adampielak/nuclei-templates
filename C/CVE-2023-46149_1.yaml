    Themify Ultra <= 7.3.3 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The themify-ultra theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in during a file upload in all versions up to, and including, 7.3.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber access or higher to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
