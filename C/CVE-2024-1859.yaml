  name: >
    Slider Responsive Slideshow – Image slider, Gallery slideshow <= 1.3.8 - Authenticated (Contributor+) PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Slider Responsive Slideshow – Image slider, Gallery slideshow plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.8 via deserialization of untrusted input to the awl_slider_responsive_shortcode function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
