info:
  name: "CRM and Lead Management by vcita <= 2.6.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The CRM and Lead Management by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6.2. This is due to missing nonce validation in the vcita-callback.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
