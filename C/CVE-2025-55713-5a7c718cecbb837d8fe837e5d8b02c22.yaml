  name: >
    Blocksy <= 2.1.6 - Authenticated (Shop manager+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Blocksy theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.1.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with shop manager-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
