id: CVE-2022-0830

info:
  name: "FormBuilder <= 1.08 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The FormBuilder WordPress plugin through 1.08 does not have CSRF checks in place when creating/updating and deleting forms, and does not sanitise as well as escape its form field values. As a result, attackers could make logged in admin update and delete arbitrary forms via a CSRF attack, and put Cross-Site Scripting payloads in them."
