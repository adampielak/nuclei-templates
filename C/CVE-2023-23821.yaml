  name: >
    Interactive Polish Map <= 1.2 - Authenticated (Admi+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Interactive Polish Map plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's settings in versions up to, and including, 1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with admin-level permissions, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
