    SureDash <= 1.0.3 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The SureDash plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting a user's ability to set roles. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to elevate their privileges.
