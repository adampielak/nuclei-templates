  name: >
    WordPress.com Editing Toolkit <= 3.78784 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WordPress.com Editing Toolkit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 3.78784 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
