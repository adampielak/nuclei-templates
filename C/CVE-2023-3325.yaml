id: CVE-2023-3325

info:
  name: "CMS Commander <= 2.287 - Authorization Bypass through Use of Insufficiently Unique Cryptographic Signature"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The CMS Commander plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to the use of an insufficiently unique cryptographic signature on the 'cmsc_add_site' function in versions up to, and including, 2.287. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to the plugin to change the '_cmsc_public_key' in the plugin config, providing access to the plugin's remote control functionalities, such as creating an admin access URL, which can be used for privilege escalation. This can only be exploited if the plugin has not been configured yet, however, if combined with another arbitrary plugin installation and activation vulnerability, the impact can be severe."
