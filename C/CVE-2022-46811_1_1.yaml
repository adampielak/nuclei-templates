    ALD Dropping and Fulfillment for AliExpress and WooCommerce <= 1.0.21 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Order Information Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The ALD Dropping and Fulfillment for AliExpress and WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.21. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions such as the 'update_ali_order_id', 'ob_get_clean', and 'get_ali_order_detail' functions to name a few. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve order information or possibly make (minor) changes to an order via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
