  name: >
    Newscrunch <= 1.8.4 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Newscrunch theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a missing capability check in the newscrunch_install_and_activate_plugin() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.4.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
