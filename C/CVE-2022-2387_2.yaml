id: CVE-2022-2387

info:
  name: "Easy Digital Downloads <= 2.11.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Post Deletion"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Easy Digital Downloads plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.11.7 . This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation when deleting payment history. Additionally, the plugin does not ensure that the item about to be deleted is payment history. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
