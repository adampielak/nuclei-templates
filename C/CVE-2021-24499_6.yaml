id: CVE-2021-24499

info:
  name: WordPress Workreap - Remote Code Execution
  author: daffainfo
  severity: critical
  description: WordPress Workreap theme is susceptible to remote code execution. The AJAX actions workreap_award_temp_file_uploader and workreap_temp_file_uploader did not perform nonce checks, or validate that the request is from a valid user in any other way. The endpoints allowed for uploading arbitrary files to the uploads/workreap-temp directory. Uploaded files were neither sanitized nor validated, allowing an unauthenticated visitor to upload executable code such as php scripts.
  impact: |
    Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected WordPress site.
  remediation: |
    Update to the latest version of the Workreap plugin to fix the vulnerability.
