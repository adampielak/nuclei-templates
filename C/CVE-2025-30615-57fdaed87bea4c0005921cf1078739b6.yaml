    WP e-Commerce Style Email <= 0.6.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Remote Code Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP e-Commerce Style Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 0.6.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
