    Schema & Structured Data for WP & AMP <= 1.29 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via How To and FAQ Blocks
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Schema & Structured Data for WP & AMP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's "How To" and "FAQ" Blocks in all versions up to, and including, 1.29 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
