id: CVE-2023-2068

info:
  name: "File Manager Advanced Shortcode WordPress <= 2.3.2 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload to Remote Code Execution via Shortcode"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The File Manager Advanced Shortcode WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to remote code execution in versions up to, and including, 2.3.2. This is due to the plugin allowing users to upload PHP files when the shortcode has been added to a page/post. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to potentially upload malicious PHP files if the shortcode is used on the front-end of the site, and makes it possible for authenticated users with access to a post editor to add the shortcode to a page or post and subsequently upload a malicious file."
