info:
  name: "HTML5 Responsive FAQ <= 2.8.5 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The HTML5 Responsive FAQ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.8.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for high privilege attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.  This exploit can occur even when unfiltered_html is disallowed."
