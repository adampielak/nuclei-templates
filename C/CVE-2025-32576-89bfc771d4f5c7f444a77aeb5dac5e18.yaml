    WP shop <= 2.6.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP shop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
