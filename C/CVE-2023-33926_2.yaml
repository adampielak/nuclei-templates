id: CVE-2023-33926

info:
  name: "Easy Google Maps <= 1.11.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Easy Google Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.11.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call that function via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is believed to be the same issue as CVE-2023-2526."
