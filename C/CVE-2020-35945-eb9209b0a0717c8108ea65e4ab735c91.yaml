    Elegant Themes (Multiple Versions) - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    An issue was discovered in the Divi Builder plugin, Divi theme, and Divi Extra theme before 4.5.3 for WordPress. Authenticated attackers, with contributor-level or above capabilities, can upload arbitrary files, including .php files. This occurs because the check for file extensions is on the client side rather than server side.
