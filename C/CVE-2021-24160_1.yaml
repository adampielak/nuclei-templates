  name: >
    Responsive Menu 4.0 - 4.0.3 - Authenticated Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    In the Reponsive Menu (free and Pro) WordPress plugins before 4.0.4, subscribers could upload zip archives containing malicious PHP files that would get extracted to the /rmp-menu/ directory. These files could then be accessed via the front end of the site to trigger remote code execution and ultimately allow an attacker to execute commands to further infect a WordPress site.
