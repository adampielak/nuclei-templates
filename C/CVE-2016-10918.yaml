  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Photo Gallery by Supsystic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'updateAttachment' action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
