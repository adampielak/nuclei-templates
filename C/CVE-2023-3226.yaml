info:
  name: >
    Popup Builder <= 4.1.15 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Popup Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 4.1.15 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
