    Alone – Charity Multipurpose Non-profit WordPress Theme <= 7.8.3 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload via Plugin Installation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Alone – Charity Multipurpose Non-profit WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a missing capability check on the alone_import_pack_install_plugin() function in all versions up to, and including, 7.8.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload zip files containing webshells disguised as plugins from remote locations to achieve remote code execution.
