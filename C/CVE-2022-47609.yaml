id: CVE-2022-47609

info:
  name: "DNUI <= 2.8.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to Unused Image Deletion and Database Image Access"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The DNUI plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the dnui.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to access administrative functions of the plugin (such as the deleting of unused images or pulling image data from the database) via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
