  name: >
    AnWP Football Leagues <= 0.16.17 - Authenticated (Administrator+) CSV Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The AnWP Football Leagues plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in all versions up to, and including, 0.16.17 via the 'download_csv_players' and 'download_csv_games' functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to embed untrusted input into exported CSV files, which can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.
