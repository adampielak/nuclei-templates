    WooCommerce Google Feed Manager <= 2.8.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary Feed Actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Google Feed Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on several functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to perform various feed actions, such as deleting a feed, duplicating a feed, and changing the status of a feed.
