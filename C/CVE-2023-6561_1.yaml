  name: >
    Featured Image from URL (FIFU) <= 4.5.3 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via featured image alt text
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Featured Image from URL (FIFU) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the featured image alt text in all versions up to, and including, 4.5.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
