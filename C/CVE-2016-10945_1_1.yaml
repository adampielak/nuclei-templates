  name: >
    Platform 4 <= 1.1.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Platform 4 theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the 'includes/library.options.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
