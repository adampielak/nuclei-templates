    WordPress Core < 6.4.3 - Authenticated(Administrator+) PHP File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    In all current versions of WordPress Core before 6.4.3, plugins uploaded via the admin area are not verified as being ZIP files. This allows for PHP files to be uploaded. Once a PHP file is uploaded, the plugin extraction fails, but the PHP file remains in a predictable wp-content/uploads location, allowing for an attacker to then execute the file. This represents a security risk in limited scenarios where an attacker (who does have the required capabilities for plugin uploads) cannot simply place arbitrary PHP code into a valid plugin ZIP file and upload that plugin, because a machine's wp-content/plugins directory permissions were set up to block all new plugins. Please note that this requires administrator or super administrator permissions(on multisite installations) and only impacts heavily locked-down installations where even these users cannot install new plugins. CVE-2024-31210 may be a duplicate of this issue.
