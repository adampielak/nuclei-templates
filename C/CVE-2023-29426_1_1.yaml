  name: >
    Spreadshop Plugin <= 1.6.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Spreadshop Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.5. This is due to missing nonce validation on the handle() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
