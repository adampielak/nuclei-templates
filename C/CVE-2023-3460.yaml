id: CVE-2023-3460

info:
  name: "Ultimate Member <= 2.6.6 - Privilege Escalation via Arbitrary User Meta Updates"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 2.6.6. This is due to the plugin using a predefined list of user meta keys that are banned which can be bypassed via a few method like adding slashes to the user meta key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register on a site as an administrator."
