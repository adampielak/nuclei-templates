info:
  name: >
    iThemes Security <= 8.1.4 - Open Redirection via redirect_to_https
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The iThemes Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to open redirection in versions up to, and including, 8.1.4. This is due to the use of wp_redirect instead of wp_safe_redirect in the redirect_to_https function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily redirect users via a forged request granted they can trick a the user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
