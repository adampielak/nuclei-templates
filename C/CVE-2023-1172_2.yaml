  name: "Bookly <= 21.5 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Name"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Bookly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the full name value in versions up to, and including, 21.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
