id: CVE-2022-4479

info:
  name: "Table of Contents Plus <= 2106 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Table of Contents Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'class' and 'label' properties in the [toc] and [sitemap_pages] shortcodes respectively in versions up to, and including, 2106 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."
