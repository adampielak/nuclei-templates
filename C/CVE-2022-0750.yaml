id: CVE-2022-0750

info:
  name: "Photoswipe Masonry Gallery <= 1.2.14 Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Photoswipe Masonry Gallery WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping and sanitization of the thumbnail_width, thumbnail_height, max_image_width, and max_image_height parameters  found in the ~/photoswipe-masonry.php file which allows authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into galleries created by the plugin and on the PhotoSwipe Options page. This affects versions up to and including 1.2.14."
