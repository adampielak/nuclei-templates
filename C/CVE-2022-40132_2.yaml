info:
  name: "Seriously Simple Podcasting <= 2.16.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Seriously Simple Podcasting plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.16.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_step function as well as other functions related to onboarding. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions and change plugin settings via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
