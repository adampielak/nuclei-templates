    Replyable – Subscribe to Comments and Reply by Email <= 2.2.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via prompt_dismiss_notice
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Replyable – Subscribe to Comments and Reply by Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery and PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 2.2.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the prompt_dismiss_notice AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to inject a PHP Object via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution if a useable gadget it installed on the site.
