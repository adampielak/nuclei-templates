    Invitation Based Registrations <= 2.2.84 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Invitation Based Registrations WordPress plugin through 2.2.84 does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)
