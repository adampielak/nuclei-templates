info:
  name: "Bitcoin / Altcoin Faucet <= 1.6.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Bitcoin / Altcoin Faucet plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation when saving plugin settings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Due to lack of sanitization of user input, an attacker may also use this vulnerability to inject malicious JavaScript, that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
