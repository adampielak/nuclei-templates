    WP Project Manager – Task, team, and project management plugin featuring kanban board and gantt charts <= 2.6.22 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Project Manager – Task, team, and project management plugin featuring kanban board and gantt charts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.22 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in tasks discussion. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and permissions granted by an Administrator, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
