    Fluent Forms – Customizable Contact Forms, Survey, Quiz, & Conversational Form Builder <= 5.2.12 - IP-Spoofing
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Fluent Forms – Customizable Contact Forms, Survey, Quiz, & Conversational Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.12 due to insufficient IP address validation and use of user-supplied HTTP headers as a primary method for IP retrieval. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers spoof their IP address and submit forms that may have IP-based restrictions.
