info:
  name: >
    Booking Calendar and Notification <= 4.0.3 - Authentication Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Booking Calendar and Notification plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.3. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to logging them in. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users which makes privilege escalation possible.
