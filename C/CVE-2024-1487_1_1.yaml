  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Photos and Files Contest Gallery – Contact Form, Upload Form, Social Share and Voting Competition Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 21.3.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on content descriptions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
