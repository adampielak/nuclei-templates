id: CVE-2022-35726

info:
  name: >
    Video Gallery â€“ YouTube Playlist, Channel Gallery by YotuWP <= 1.3.8 - Missing Authorization
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the deletecache function in versions up to, and including, 1.3.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear the plugin's cache. The plugin added an "is_admin" check in version 1.3.5 but this would not be sufficient access control to prevent even unauthenticated attackers from exploiting the vulnerability.
