info:
  name: "Follow Me Plugin <= 3.1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The 'Follow Me Plugin' plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.1.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the FollowMeIgniteSocialMedia_options_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
