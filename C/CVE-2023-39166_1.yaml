    tagDiv Composer <= 4.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The tagDiv Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts into pages via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
