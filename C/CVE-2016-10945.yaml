  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Platform 4 theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.4.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
