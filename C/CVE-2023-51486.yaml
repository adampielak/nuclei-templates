  name: >
    WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder <= 1.2.101 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.101. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the /pages/invoice_list.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete invoices via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
