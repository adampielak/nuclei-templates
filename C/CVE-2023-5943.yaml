    Wp-Adv-Quiz <= 1.0.2 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Quiz Question and Message
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Wp-Adv-Quiz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a quiz question and message in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
