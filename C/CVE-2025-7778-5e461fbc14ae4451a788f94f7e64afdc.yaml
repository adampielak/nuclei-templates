    Icons Factory <= 1.6.12 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion via delete_files() Function
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Icons Factory plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Deletion due to insufficient authorization and improper path validation within the delete_files() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.12. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
