  name: >
    Woffice Core <= 5.4.26 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Woffice Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the woffice_file_manager_delete() function in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.26. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
