  name: >
    Read More & Accordion <= 3.4.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Local File Inclusion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Read More & Accordion plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the addNewButtons() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary PHP files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
