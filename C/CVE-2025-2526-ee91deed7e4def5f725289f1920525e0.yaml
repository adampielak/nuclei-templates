    Streamit <= 4.0.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation via User Email Change/Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Streamit theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email in the 'st_Authentication_Controller::edit_profile' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.
