info:
  name: >
    WP User Frontend <= 3.6.5 - Authenticated (Author+) Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP User Frontend â€“ Registration, User Profile, Membership, Content Restriction, User Directory, and Frontend Post Submission Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.5. This is due to the plugin not providing sufficient controls on the ability to supply a role on the registration form shortcode rendered via the registration_form function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to add a registration form to a page with the role set to administrator and then subsequently use the form to register as an administrator.
