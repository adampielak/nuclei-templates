id: CVE-2022-0537

info:
  name: "MapPress Maps for WordPress <= 2.73.12 - Admin+ File Upload to Remote Code Execution"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The MapPress Maps for WordPress plugin before 2.73.13 allows a high privileged user to bypass the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT and DISALLOW_FILE_MODS settings and upload arbitrary files to the site through the 'ajax_save' function. The file is written relative to the current 's stylesheet directory, and a .php file extension is added. No validation is performed on the content of the file, triggering an RCE vulnerability by uploading a web shell. Further the name parameter is not sanitized, allowing the payload to be uploaded to any directory to which the server has write access."
