  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Download Theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.9.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download theme zips on others computers, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
