info:
  name: >
    DSGVO All in one for WP <= 4.2 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The DSGVO All in one for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘dsdvo_customimprinttext’ parameter in versions up to, and including, 4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. 
    
    4.2. was intended to provide a fix, but does not sufficiently address this issue.
