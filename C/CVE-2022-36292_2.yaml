  name: "Gallery PhotoBlocks <= 1.2.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Gallery PhotoBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.8. This is due to missing nonce validation on the init() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete or copy photo galleries via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
