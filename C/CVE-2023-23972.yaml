info:
  name: >
    Social Like Box and Page by WpDevArt <= 0.8.39 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Social Like Box and Page by WpDevArt plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via select elements in versions up to, and including, 0.8.39 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
