id: CVE-2022-33994

info:
  name: "Gutenberg <= 13.7.3 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "The Gutenberg  plugin for WordPress has been reported to be vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 13.7.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to embed remote SVG files as images in blog posts. As these files use <img> tags, no code can be executed in the context of the WordPress site. However, if the attacker can get a victim to visit the remotely hosted SVG file then any JavaScript in that file will execute in their browser in the context of the remote site."
