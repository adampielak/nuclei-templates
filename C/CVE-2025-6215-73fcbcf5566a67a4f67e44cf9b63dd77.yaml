    Omnishop <= 1.0.9 - Missing Registration Restriction to Unauthenticated Account Creation via /users/register REST Endpoint
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Omnishop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Registration Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. Its /users/register endpoint is exposed to the public (permission_callback always returns true) and invokes wp_create_user() unconditionally,  ignoring the siteâ€™s users_can_register option and any nonce or CAPTCHA checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create arbitrary user accounts (customer) on sites where registrations should be closed.
