  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    Multiple FunnelKit plugins are vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure via the wf_get_cookie shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract sensitive data including authentication cookies of other site users, which may make privilege escalation possible.
        
        Please note both FunnelKit – Funnel Builder for WooCommerce Checkout AND FunnelKit Automations – Email Marketing Automation and CRM for WordPress & WooCommerce are affected by this.
