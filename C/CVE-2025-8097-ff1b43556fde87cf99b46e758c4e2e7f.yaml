    WoodMart - Multipurpose WooCommerce Theme <= 8.2.6 - Improper Input Validation Leading to Unauthenticated Cart Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WoodMart theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Improper Input Validation in all versions up to, and including, 8.2.6. This is due to insufficient validation of the qty parameter in the woodmart_update_cart_item function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate cart quantities using fractional values, allowing them to obtain products for free by setting extremely small quantities (e.g., 0.00001) that round cart totals to $0.00, effectively bypassing payment requirements and allowing unauthorized acquisition of virtual or downloadable products.
