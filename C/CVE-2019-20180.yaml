id: CVE-2019-20180

info:
  name: "TablePress <= 1.14 - Authenticated (Author+) CSV Injection"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The TablePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in versions up to and including 1.14 via the tablepress[data] value. This makes it possible for attackers with author level access and above to embed untrusted input into exported CSV files, which can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration. This vulnerability is not likely to be exploited in the wild due to its high complexity and many modern day protections, however, it could have a significant impact if exploited successfully at it's worst impact. Please note that while the CVE record says this issue was patched in 1.10, our team confirmed it was still exploitable in 1.14. The has been patched in version 2.0 of TablePress."
