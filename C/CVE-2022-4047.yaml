info:
  name: "Return Refund and Exchange For WooCommerce <= 4.0.8 - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Return Refund and Exchange For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the wps_rma_order_return_attach_files function in versions up to, and including, 4.0.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
