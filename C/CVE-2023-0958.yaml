    Inisev Plugins (Various Versions) - Missing Authorization on handle_installation function
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    Several plugins for WordPress by Inisev are vulnerable to unauthorized installation of plugins due to a missing capability check on the handle_installation function that is called via the inisev_installation AJAX aciton in various versions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as subscribers, to install select plugins from Inisev on vulnerable sites. CVE-2023-38514 appears to be a duplicate of this vulnerability.
