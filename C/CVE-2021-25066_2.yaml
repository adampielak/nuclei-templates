info:
  name: "Ninja Ninja Forms Contact Form <= 3.6.10 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via import"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Ninja Forms Contact Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters found in an import in versions up to, and including, 3.6.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative level permissions and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."
