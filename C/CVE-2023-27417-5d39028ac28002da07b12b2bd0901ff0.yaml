    Affiliate Super Assistent <= 1.5.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update and Cache Clearing
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Affiliate Super Assistent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions such as the '_displayPreDispatcher', '_displayDispatcher', & '_displayTestPage' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform many actions like updating plugin settings via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
