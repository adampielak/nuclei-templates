info:
  name: "Big Store <= 1.9.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Plugin Activation"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Big Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.9.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the default_home and th_activeplugin functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
