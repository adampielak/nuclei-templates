  name: >
    WooHoo Newspaper Magazine Theme <= 2.5.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooHoo Newspaper Magazine Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the /wp-admin/admin.php?page=mypanel&do=submit page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The impact of this vulnerability is unknown.
