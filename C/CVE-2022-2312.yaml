id: CVE-2022-2312

info:
  name: "Student Result or Employee Database <= 1.7.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Student Result or Employee Database plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery on its ajax actions in versions up to, and including, 1.7.4 due to improper or missing nonce verification. This allows unauthenticated attackers to utilize these ajax actions to add or delete students/employees provided they can trick a contributor or higher-privileged user into clicking on a link. Furthermore, due to insufficient input sanitization of user input, this weakness can be utilized for Stored Cross-Site Scripting."
