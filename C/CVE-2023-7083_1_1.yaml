  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Voting Record plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugins settings and inject JS granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The impact of this vulnerability is unknown.
