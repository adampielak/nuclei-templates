  name: "Cost of Goods for WooCommerce <= 2.8.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery in save_costs"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Cost of Goods for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.8.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_costs function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit or save of prices via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
