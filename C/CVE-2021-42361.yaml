  description: "The Contact Form Email WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input validation and escaping via the name parameter found in the ~/trunk/cp-admin-int-list.inc.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.3.24. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled."
