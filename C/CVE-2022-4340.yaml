info:
  name: "BookingPress <= 1.0.30 - Unauthenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The BookingPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to insecure direct object reference in versions up to, and including, 1.0.30. This is due to insufficient validation on the 'appointment_id' user-controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve booking information that includes booked services along with the name and time of booking."
