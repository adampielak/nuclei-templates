info:
  name: "Etsy Shop <= 3.0.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Plugin Settings Update"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Etsy Shop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.0.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the etsy_shop_options_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Version 3.0.3 included a partial fix."
