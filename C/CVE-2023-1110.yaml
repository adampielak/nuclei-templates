info:
  name: "Yellow Yard Searchbar <= 2.7.27 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Yellow Yard Searchbar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's yy_filter and yy_filter_container shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 2.7.27 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
