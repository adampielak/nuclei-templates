id: CVE-2021-24171

info:
  name: "WooCommerce Upload Files <= 59.3 - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The WooCommerce Upload Files WordPress plugin before 59.4 ran a single sanitization pass to remove blocked extensions such as .php. It was possible to bypass this and upload a file with a PHP extension by embedding a 'blocked' extension within another 'blocked' extension in the 'wcuf_file_name' parameter. It was also possible to perform a double extension attack and upload files to a different location via path traversal using the 'wcuf_current_upload_session_id' parameter."
