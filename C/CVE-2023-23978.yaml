  name: >
    WP Client Reports <= 1.0.16 - Missing Authorization to Sensitive Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Client Reports plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 1.0.16 via the wp_client_reports_send_email_report_from_ajax() function due to a missing capability check. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to extract sensitive data, including information stored in client reports. Please note that this still appears to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery.
