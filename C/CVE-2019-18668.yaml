id: CVE-2019-18668

info:
  name: "Currency Switcher <= 2.11.1 - Authorization Bypass"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "An issue was discovered in the Currency Switcher addon before 2.11.2 for WooCommerce if a user provides a currency that was not added by the administrator. In this case, even though the currency does not exist, it will be selected, but a price amount will fall back to the default currency. This means that if an attacker provides a currency that does not exist and is worth less than this default, the attacker can eventually purchase an item for a significantly cheaper price."
