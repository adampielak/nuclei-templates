    Taxi Booking Manager for Woocommerce | E-cab <= 1.3.0 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via Account Takeover
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Taxi Booking Manager for Woocommerce | E-cab plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's capabilities prior to updating a plugin setting or their identity prior to updating their details like email address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.
