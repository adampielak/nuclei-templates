    Civi - Job Board & Freelance Marketplace WordPress Theme <= 2.1.4 - Authentication Bypass via Password Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Civi - Job Board & Freelance Marketplace WordPress Theme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.4. This is due to a lack of user validation before changing a password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the password of arbitrary users, including administrators, if the attacker knows the username of the victim.
