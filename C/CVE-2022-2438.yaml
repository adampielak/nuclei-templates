id: CVE-2022-2438

info:
  name: "Broken Link Checker <= 1.11.16 - Authenticated (Admin+) PHAR Deserialization"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Broken Link Checker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the '$log_file' value in versions up to, and including 1.11.16. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative privileges and above to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload."
