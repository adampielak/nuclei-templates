  name: >
    Feed Them Social â€“ for Twitter feed, Youtube and more <= 2.9.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Settings update
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Feed Them Social plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on various functions such as fts_instagram_token_ajax(). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger settings updates via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
