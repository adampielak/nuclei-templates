    Contact Form Email <= 1.3.31 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Feedback Submission
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Contact Form Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.31. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the cpcfte_feedback function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to submit plugin feedback via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
