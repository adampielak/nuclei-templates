  name: >
    Profile Builder <= 3.10.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via pms-cross-promotion.php
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The User Profile Builder â€“ Beautiful User Registration Forms, User Profiles & User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.10.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wppb_activate_pms_plugin and wppb_deactivate_pms_plugin functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate and deactivate arbitrary plugins via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
