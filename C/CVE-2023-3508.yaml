info:
  name: >
    WooCommerce Pre-Orders <= 2.0.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Pre-Orders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke these functions and perform actions such as email pre-order customers, change released dates, mark all pre-orders complete for specific products, and cancel pre-orders for products via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
