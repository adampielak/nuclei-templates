  name: >
    WP Editor <= 1.2.9.1 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Directory Traversal to Arbitrary File Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file update due to missing file path validation in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.9.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible assuming the files can be written to by the web server.
