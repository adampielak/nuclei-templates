info:
  name: >
    WP Custom Admin Interface <= 7.28 - Authenticated (Administrator+) PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WP Custom Admin Interface plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 7.28, via deserialization of untrusted input in the northernbeacheswebsites_information and wp_custom_admin_interface_import_settings functions. This allows administrator-level attackers to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. The vulnerability is patched by setting allowed_classes. While this makes the vulnerability more or less unexploitable, PHP recommends not passing untrusted input to the unserialize function.
