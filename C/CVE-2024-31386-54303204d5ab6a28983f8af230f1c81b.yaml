    Multiple Themes (Various Versions) - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Notice Dismissal
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in various versions. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on variations of the dismiss() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
