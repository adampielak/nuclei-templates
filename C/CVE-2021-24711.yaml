info:
  name: "Software License Manager <= 4.5.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to Arbitrary Domain Deletion"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Software License Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.5.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the del_reistered_domains AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete an entry in the plugin's registered domain database table via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
