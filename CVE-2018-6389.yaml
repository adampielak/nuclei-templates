info:
  name: >
    WordPress Core <= 4.9.8 - Denial of Service
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    In WordPress through 4.9.2, unauthenticated attackers can cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by using the large list of registered .js files (from wp-includes/script-loader.php) to construct a series of requests to load every file many times. It looks like most of the slowness was due to forcing PHP to repeatedly compress the output scripts, which was addressed in 4.9.9.
