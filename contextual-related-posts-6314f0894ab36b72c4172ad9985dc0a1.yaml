    Contextual Related Posts <= 2.9.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Contextual Related Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the crp_process_settings_export() or crp_process_settings_import() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform administrative actions and/or obtain unauthorized information via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
