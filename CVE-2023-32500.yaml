  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Woodmart theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 7.1.1.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's license via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
