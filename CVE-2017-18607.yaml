info:
  name: "Avada <= 5.1.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Avada theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.1.4. This is due to missing nonce validation on the fusion_builder_importer() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger the importer and upload arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
