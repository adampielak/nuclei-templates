    WP Courses LMS <= 3.2.3 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Options Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Courses LMS â€“ Online Courses Builder, eLearning Courses, Courses Solution, Education Courses plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to missing capability check on the wpc_save_fe_option() function hooked via AJAX in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options which can be used to achieve privilege escalation on most instances.
