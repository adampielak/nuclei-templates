    Golo - Directory & Listing, Travel WordPress Theme <= 1.6.10 - Missing Authorization to Privilege Escalation via Unauthenticated Arbitrary User Password Change
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Golo - City Travel Guide WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.10. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.
