  severity: medium
  description: "The EELV Newsletter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.6.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the 'eelv-newsletter/trunk/lettreinfo.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
