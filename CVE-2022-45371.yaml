info:
  name: >
    ShopEngine <= 4.1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via get_product
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The ShopEngine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the get_product function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update product IDs via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
