id: CVE-2023-0505

info:
  name: "Ever Compare <= 1.2.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary Plugin Activation"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Ever Compare plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on functions such as 'plugin_activation'. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins already installed (but deactivated) on the site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
