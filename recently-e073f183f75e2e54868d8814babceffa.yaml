info:
  name: "Recently <= 3.0.4 - Arbitrary File Upload to Remote Code Exectution"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Recently plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the fetch_external_image() function in versions up to, and including, 3.0.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible."
