  name: "Tracked Tweets <= 0.2.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Tracked Tweets plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 0.2.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the ~/tracked-tweets/trackedtweets.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject arbitrary web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
