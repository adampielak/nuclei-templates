  name: "Real Estate by Templatic (Unknown Version) - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Realestate theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads via CSRF due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the 'upload-file.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible."
