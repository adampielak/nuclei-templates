  name: "Reality | Estate Multipurpose WordPress Theme <= 2.5.5 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Reality theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.5.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'keyword' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
