  name: "Related Posts for WordPress <= 2.1.1 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Related Posts for WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of unsanitized user input when constructing a URL in versions up to, and including, 2.1.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is unlikely to work in newer browsers."
