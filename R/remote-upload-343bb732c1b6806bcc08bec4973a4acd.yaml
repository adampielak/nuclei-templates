  name: "WP Remote Upload <= 1.2.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WP Remote Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible."
