info:
  name: "Real Estate 7 WordPress < 2.9.5 - Multiple Vulnerabilities"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Real Estate 7 WordPress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to both Reflected and Stored Cross-Site Scripting, Insecure Direct Object Reference, and Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 2.9.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, along with exposure of email addresses in hidden form fields. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page, and view sensitive information including order information, usernames, and email addresses."
