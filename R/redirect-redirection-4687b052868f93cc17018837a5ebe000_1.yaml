    Redirect Redirection <= 1.1.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via 'bulkDelete' function
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Redirect Redirection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the bulkDelete function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete redirect rules in bulk, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
