  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The RocketTheme's Refraction Theme is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting, Content Spoofing, and Path Traversal in versions up to, and including, 1.3. This is due to inclusion of a vulnerable versions of RokBox and JW Player. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser, create fake content, and read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information. The theme directory can be named either 'refraction' or 'rt_refraction_wp'."
