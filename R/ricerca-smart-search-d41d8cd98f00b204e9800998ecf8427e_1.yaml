  name: "Ricerca smart and advanced search <= 1.0.15 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Ricerca smart and advanced search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.15. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the saveSettings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
