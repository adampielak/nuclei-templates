  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "The Coming Soon Page & Maintenance Mode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated settings reset in versions up to, and including 1.8.1 due to missing capability checks in the ~/functions/data-reset-post.php file which makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger a plugin settings reset."
