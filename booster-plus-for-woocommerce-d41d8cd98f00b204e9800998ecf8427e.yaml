  name: "Booster for WooCommerce (Free <= 5.6.2 and Premium <= 5.6.0) - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Order Modification"
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "The Booster for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to order modification due to a missing capability/authorization check in versions up to, and including, 5.6.2 (free) or 5.6.0 (premium). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to modify their own orders, which includes the ability to mark them as paid."
