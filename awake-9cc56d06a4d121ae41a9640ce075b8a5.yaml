  name: "Awake <= 3.3 - Arbitrary File Deletion"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Awake Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Deletion in versions up to, and including, 3.3. This is due to the '_mysite_delete_skin_zip' parameter in the 'dl-skin.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete any file on the server of the vulnerable service."
