id: CVE-2021-24780

info:
  name: "Single Post Exporter <= 1.1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Single Post Exporter WordPress plugin through 1.1.1 does not have CSRF checks when saving its settings, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack and give access to the export feature to any role such as subscriber. Subscriber users would then be able to export an arbitrary post/page (such as private and password protected) via a direct URL."
