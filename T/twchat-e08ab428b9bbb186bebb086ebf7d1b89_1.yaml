    Two Way CHAT â€“ Send or receive messages to your user <= 3.1.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Two Way Chat plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to multiple Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.1.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on multiple functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute otherwise unauthorized administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
