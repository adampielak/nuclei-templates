  name: "Trust Payments Gateway (3DS2) <= 1.2.0 -  Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Trust Payments Gateway (3DS2) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the tpgw_refund_purchase() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to refund order purchases via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
