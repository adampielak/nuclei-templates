info:
  name: "WP Private Content Plus <= 3.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery Bypass"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WP Private Content Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_groups() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add new group members via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
