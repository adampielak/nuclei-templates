  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Five Star Business Profile and Schema WordPress plugin before 2.1.7 does not have any authorisation and CSRF in its bpfwp_welcome_add_contact_page and bpfwp_welcome_set_contact_information AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscribers, to call them. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation, it also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues"
