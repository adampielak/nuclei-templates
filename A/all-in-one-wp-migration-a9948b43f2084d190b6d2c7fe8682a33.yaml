    All-in-One WP Migration <= 2.0.2 - Authorization Bypass to Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The All-in-One WP Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the import() function in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files.
