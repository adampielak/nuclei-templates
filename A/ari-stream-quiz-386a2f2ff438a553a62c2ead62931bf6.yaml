    ARI Stream Quiz <= 1.2.32 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The ARI Stream Quiz â€“ WordPress Quizzes Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.32. This is due to missing nonce validation on several execute() functions found in various files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to copy, delete, and save quizzes via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
