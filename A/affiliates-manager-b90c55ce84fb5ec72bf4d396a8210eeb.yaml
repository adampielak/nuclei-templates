    Affiliates Manager <= 2.9.13 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Affiliates Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.13. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the process_individual_action function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete affiliates and commissions, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
