  name: "Appointment Booking Calendar <= 1.2.24 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Appointment Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters such as the 'name' and 'ict' parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.2.24. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping and makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
