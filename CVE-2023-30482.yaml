  name: >
    WPBulky <= 1.0.10 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WPBulky plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.0.10 due to insufficient input sanitization via the 'sanitize' function which does not sufficiently sanitize content that does not contain HTML tags, as well as insufficient output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
