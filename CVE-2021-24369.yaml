id: CVE-2021-24369

info:
  name: "WordPress Payments Plugin | GetPaid <= 2.3.3 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "In the GetPaid WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, users with the contributor role and above can create a new Payment Form, however the Label and Help Text input fields were not getting sanitized properly. So it was possible to inject malicious content such as img tags, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue which is triggered when the form will be edited, for example when an admin reviews it and could lead to privilege escalation."
