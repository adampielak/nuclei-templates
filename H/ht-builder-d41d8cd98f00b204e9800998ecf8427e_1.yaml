  name: "HT Builder <= 1.2.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via plugin_activation"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The HT Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.9. This is due to missing nonce validation on the plugin_activation() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate arbitrary plugins, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
