info:
  name: "Ship To eCourier <= 1.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Ship To eCourier plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ste-ecourier-settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
