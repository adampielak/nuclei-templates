  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Form Builder CP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.2.31 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
