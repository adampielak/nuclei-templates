  name: "Ultimate Member <= 2.6.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Form Duplication"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the duplicate_form function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to duplicate forms created with the plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
