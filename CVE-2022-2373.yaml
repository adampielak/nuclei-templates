  name: >
    Simply Schedule Appointments <= 1.5.7.5 - Unauthenticated Sensitive Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Simply Schedule Appointments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information exposure in versions up to, and including 1.5.7.5 due to missing capability checks on the /wp-json/ssa/v1/users REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve a list of email addresses associated with the users that are registered on the site.
