  name: "FAQs Manager <= 1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The FAQs Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the inic_faq_settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily change plugin settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
