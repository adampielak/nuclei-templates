id: CVE-2022-44630

info:
  name: "YITH plugins by YITHEMES <= (Various Versions) - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "Several YITHEMES plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the create_log_file function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create an error or debug log file using the plugin, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The function allows the user to specify the file name. Please note that the unpatched plugins from this developer are the FREE versions of the plugin that were available on the WordPress.org repository. The developer is still maintaining the premium versions of the plugins which have been patched."
