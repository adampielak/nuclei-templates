  name: >
    myStickymenu <= 2.6.4 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Form Lead Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Floating Notification Bar, Sticky Menu on Scroll, Announcement Banner, and Sticky Header for Any Theme â€“ My Sticky Bar (formerly myStickymenu) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the my_sticky_menu_bulks() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscruber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary form leads. There were several additional AJAX actions in the plugin with missing capability checks as well such as mystickymenu_admin_send_message_to_owner(), stickymenu_widget_delete(), mystickymenu_widget_status() and more that make is possible for authenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions.
