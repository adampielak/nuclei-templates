info:
  name: "Feather12 (Unkown Versions) - Multiple Vulnerabilities"
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "The Feather12 theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting, Content Spoofing, and Path Traversal in all versions. This is due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of jPlayer. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser, create fake content, and read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information."
