  name: "Occasions <= 1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Occasions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the 'occasions.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain otherwise restricted access to administrative actions which can result in XSS via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
