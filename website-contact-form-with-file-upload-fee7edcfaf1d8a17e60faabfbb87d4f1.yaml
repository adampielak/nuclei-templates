info:
  name: "Website Contact Form With File Upload < 1.4 - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The Website Contact Form With File Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the upload_file function in versions before 1.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
