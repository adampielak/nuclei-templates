  name: "Yoast Duplicate Post <= 3.2.3 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Yoast Duplicate Post plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.2.3. This makes it possible for high-level authenticated users, such as administrators, to inject arbitrary web scripts into administrative pages via several parameters such as 'duplicate_post_title_prefix'. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."
