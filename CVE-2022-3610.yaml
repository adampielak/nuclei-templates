info:
  name: "Jeeng Push Notifications <= 2.0.3 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Jeeng Push Notifications plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'client_id' parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.0.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for administrator-level attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
