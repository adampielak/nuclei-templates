    Music Player for WooCommerce <= 1.0.172 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Music Player for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting several parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.0.172  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
