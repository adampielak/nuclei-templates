  name: "MC4WP: Mailchimp for WordPress <= 4.8.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The MC4WP: Mailchimp for WordPress for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.8.4. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'listen_for_actions' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss notices and delete log files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
