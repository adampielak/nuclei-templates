  name: "Social Media Share Buttons <= 3.8.3 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Social Media Share Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.8.3, due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."
