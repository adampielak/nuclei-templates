  name: "Make A Statement (All Versions) - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Make A Statement theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'upload-handler.php' file in all known versions. This makes it possible for attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
