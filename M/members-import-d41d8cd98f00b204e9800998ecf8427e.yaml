  name: "Members Import <= 1.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to User Import and Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Members Import for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the memberimport_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to import new users or inject malicious JavaScript, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
