  name: "MyBookTable Bookstore <= 3.2.2 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The MyBookTable Bookstore plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 3.2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser if they can trick an authenticated user into performing an action, such as clicking a link."
