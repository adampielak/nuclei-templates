  name: "Myriad <= 2.0 - Arbitrary File Download"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Myriad Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Download in versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to the '_mysite_download_skin' parameter in the 'dl-skin.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download any file within the server of the vulnerable service."
