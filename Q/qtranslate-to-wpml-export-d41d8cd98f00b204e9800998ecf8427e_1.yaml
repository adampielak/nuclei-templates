  name: "qTranslate X Cleanup and WPML Import <= 3.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via clean_ajx"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The qTranslate X Cleanup and WPML Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the clean_ajx function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger the 'clean' functionality via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
