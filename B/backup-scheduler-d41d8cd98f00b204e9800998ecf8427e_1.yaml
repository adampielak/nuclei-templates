  name: "Backup Scheduler <= 1.5.13 - Missing Authorization to Sensitive Information Disclosure"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Backup Scheduler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.5.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to download the logs of the plugin which can contain sensitive information, in addition to several other actions such as deleting and modifying back-ups."
