    BuddyPress <= 7.2.1 -  Insufficient Privilege De-escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The BuddyPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the can_user_delete_or_update( ) function from versions starting at 7.0.0 to 7.2.1. This makes it possible for recently demoted user to modify groups in which they were the original creator.
