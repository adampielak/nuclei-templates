  name: ADB Backup Enabled
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: low
  description: |
    The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) backup feature is enabled, allowing for the backup and restore of application data through the ADB interface. This setting is controlled by the `android:allowBackup` attribute in the application's manifest file. When set to `true`, it permits users to perform backups of application data, which could potentially include sensitive information.
    
    Enabling ADB backup can be a security risk as it may allow unauthorized access to application data if the device is compromised or if an attacker gains physical access to the device. Therefore, it is recommended to disable this feature for applications that handle sensitive data or require higher security standards.
  remediation: |
    To remediate this issue, set the `android:allowBackup` attribute to `false` in the Android manifest file. This will disable the ADB backup feature and help protect the application's data from unauthorized access.
    
    ```xml
    <application
        android:allowBackup="false"
        ... >
        ...
    </application>
    ```
