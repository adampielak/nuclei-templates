  name: >
    WooCommerce Cart Abandonment Recovery <= 1.2.26 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Templates/Abandoned Orders Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WooCommerce Cart Abandonment Recovery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.26. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the process_bulk_action function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete templates or abandoned orders via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
