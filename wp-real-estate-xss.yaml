  name: WordPress Real Estate 7 Theme <= 3.3.4 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: Harsh
  severity: medium
  description: |
    The Real Estate 7 premium theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack vector in versions up to, and including, v3.3.4 via the 'ct_additional_features' option due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious JavaScript payload in the search page that execute if they can trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
