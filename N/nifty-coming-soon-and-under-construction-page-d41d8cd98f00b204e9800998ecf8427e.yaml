  name: "Coming Soon & Maintenance Mode Page <= 1.57 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Coming Soon & Maintenance Mode Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.57. This is due to confusing logic functions missing or having incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain and perform otherwise unauthorized access and actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
