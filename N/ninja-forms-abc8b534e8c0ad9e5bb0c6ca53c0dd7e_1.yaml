    Ninja Forms Contact Form – The Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress <= 3.6.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Field Import and PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Ninja Forms Contact Form – The Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 3.6.9, due to missing nonce validation on the import_fields_listener() function that makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to import new form fields granted that can trick an attacker into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
    
    This CSRF vulnerability can also be exploited to achieve PHP Object Injection due to the use of unserialize() on the user supplied file contents.
