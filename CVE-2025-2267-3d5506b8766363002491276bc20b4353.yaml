    WP01 â€“ Speed, Security, SEO consultant <= 2.6.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Download
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP01 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Download in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.2 due to a missing capability check and insufficient restrictions on the make_archive() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to download and read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.
