  name: "Role Based Pricing for WooCommerce <= 1.6.1 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Role Based Pricing for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation, and insufficient authorization in versions up to, and including, 1.6.1.
