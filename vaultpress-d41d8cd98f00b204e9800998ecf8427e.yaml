info:
  name: "VaultPress <= 1.8.6 - Remote Code Execution"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The VaultPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in versions up to, and including, 1.8.6 via the vaultpress/class.vaultpress-ixr-ssl-client.php file. This allows unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server. This requires a man in the middle attack to be successful as an attacker needs to obtain the secret key retrieved from https://www.vaultpress.com. The plugin does not force the use of SSL to retrieve this secret key making it readable to attackers analyzing the traffic."
