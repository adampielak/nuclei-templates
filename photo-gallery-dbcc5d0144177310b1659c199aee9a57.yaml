  name: "Photo Gallery by 10Web <= 1.5.78 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Uploaded SVG"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Photo Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.5.78 due to insufficient sanitization and escaping on SVG uploads. This makes it possible for low-level authenticated attackers, such as authors, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
