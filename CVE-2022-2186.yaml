info:
  name: "Simple Post Notes <= 1.7.5 - Subscriber+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Simple Post Notes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to subscriber+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'spnote' parameter saved via the save_bulkedit_note() function which gets called through the wp_ajax_spnote_save_bulk_edit AJAX action. This affects versions up to 1.7.6, and version 1.7.6 is still vulnerable to unauthorized post note changes by subscriber level users due to a missing capability check on the spnote_save_bulk_edit action."
