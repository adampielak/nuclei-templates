id: CVE-2023-22716

info:
  name: "OOPSpam Anti-Spam <= 1.1.35 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The OOPSpam Anti-Spam plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via options such as 'oopspam_wpregister_spam_message', 'oopspam_woo_spam_message', and 'oopspam_give_spam_message' (as well as numerous others) in versions up to, and including, 1.1.35 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for administrator-level attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
