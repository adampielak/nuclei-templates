  name: >
    1app Business Forms <= 1.0.0 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The 1app Business Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via an unknown parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for author-level attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
