id: CVE-2022-41134

info:
  name: "Optinly <= 1.0.15 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Optinly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.15. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several of its functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Note the developer attempted to patch the issue, however, the plugin is still vulnerable by simply omitting the `csrfToken` value."
