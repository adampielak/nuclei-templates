    WP EXtra <= 6.2 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Email Sending
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP EXtra plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access to restricted functionality due to a missing capability check on the 'test-email' section of the register() function in versions up to, and including, 6.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to send emails with arbitrary content to arbitrary locations from the affected site's mail server.
