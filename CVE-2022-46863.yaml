info:
  name: >
    Quick Event Manager <= 9.6.4 - Authenticated(Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The  Quick Event Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 9.6.4  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
