  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Robo Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 3.2.9.

Furthermore, several of these AJAX actions were missing Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection."
