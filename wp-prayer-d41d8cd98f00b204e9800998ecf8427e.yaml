  name: "WP Prayer <= 1.5.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WP Prayer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpe_ajax_call function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to have users unknowingly execute actions via a forged request."
