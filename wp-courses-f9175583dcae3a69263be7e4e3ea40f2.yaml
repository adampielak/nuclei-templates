    WP Courses LMS <= 3.2.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Courses LMS â€“ Online Courses Builder, eLearning Courses, Courses Solution, Education Courses plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.3. This is due to missing nonce validation on several functions hooked via AJAX in the ~/ajax/ajax-lesson-order.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to perform several actions such as adding, deleting and renaming lesson modules via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
