    Search in Place <= 1.0.104 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Feedback Submission
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Search in Place plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.104. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the feedback_action function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to submit plugin feedback on behalf of the site owner via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
