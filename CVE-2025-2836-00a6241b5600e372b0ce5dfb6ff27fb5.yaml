    RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms, User Registration, Payment, and User Login <= 6.0.4.3 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms, User Registration, Payment, and User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘payment_method’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.4.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
