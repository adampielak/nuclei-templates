  name: "Acunetix WP Security <= 4.0.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Acunetix WP Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.0.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the ~/box-database-backup.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger a database back-up via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
