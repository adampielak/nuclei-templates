  name: "vSlider Multi Image Slider <= 4.1.2 - Missing Authorization"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The vSlider Multi Image Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data, modification of data, and loss of data due to missing capability checks on several functions such as vslider_admin_callback, vslider_images_callback, and vslider_generate_images_callback in versions up to, and including, 4.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to modify the plugin's settings, retrieve settings, and manipulate sliders."
