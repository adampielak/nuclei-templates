    Paid Memberships Pro - Courses for Membership Add On <= 1.2.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Course Modifications
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Paid Memberships Pro - Courses for Membership Add On plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing nonce verification on the pmpro_courses_update_course_callback() and pmpro_courses_remove_course_callback() functions called via AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update and remove courses from the course page via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
