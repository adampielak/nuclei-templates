  name: "PWA for WP & AMP <= 1.7.32 - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The PWA for WP & AMP for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the pwaforwp_splashscreen_uploader function in versions up to, and including, 1.7.32. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
