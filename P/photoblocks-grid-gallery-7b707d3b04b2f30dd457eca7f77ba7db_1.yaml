    Gallery PhotoBlocks <= 1.2.8 - Missing Authorization Checks
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Gallery PhotoBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including 1.2.8 due to missing capability checks on the init() function found in the ~/admin/class-photoblocks-admin.php file. This makes it possible for authenticated users with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to delete and clone gallery photoblocks.
