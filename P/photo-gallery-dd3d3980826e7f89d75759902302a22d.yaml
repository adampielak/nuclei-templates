  name: "Photo Gallery by 10Web <= 1.6.7 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Photo Gallery by 10Web plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 1.6.7  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute whenever a victim accesses the injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."
