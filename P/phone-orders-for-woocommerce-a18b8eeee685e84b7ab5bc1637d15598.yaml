  name: "Phone Orders for WooCommerce <= 3.7.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Phone Orders for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.7.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the ajax_gate function which controls many additional functions also missing nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function and perform actions on behalf of administrators, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
