    Paid Memberships Pro – Restrict Member Access to Content, Courses, Communities – Free or Paid Subscriptions <= 2.5.9.1 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Paid Memberships Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the edit order page in versions up to, and including, 2.5.9.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
