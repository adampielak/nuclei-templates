  name: "Responsive Image Slider, Photo Gallery And Carousel < 1.3.6 - Missing Authorization"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Responsive Image Slider, Photo Gallery And Carousel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary post access due to a missing capability check on the sf_image_id function in versions before 1.3.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level privileges or above to arbitrarily access posts, including password protected posts."
