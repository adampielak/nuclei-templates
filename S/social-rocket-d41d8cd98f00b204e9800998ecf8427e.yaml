  name: "Social Rocket <= 1.2.9 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Social Rocket plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the admin_settings_post_actions() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain access to otherwise restricted administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
