  name: "Strong Testimonials <= 2.51.2 - Authorization Bypass"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Strong Testimonials plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the wpmtst_ajax_cat_count function and wpmtst_add_field_* functions in versions up to, and including, 2.51.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to add testimonials. It is also possible for unauthenticated attackers to add testimonials via a forged request granted they can trick a site user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
