  name: "Simple Backup <= 2.7.10 - Arbitrary File Download via Path Traversal"
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "The Simple Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Download in versions up to, and including, 2.7.10. via the download_backup_file function. This is due to a lack of capability checks and file type validation. This makes it possible for attackers to download sensitive files such as the wp-config.php file from the affected site."
