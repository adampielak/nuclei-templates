  name: "Simple Membership <= 4.0.3 - Authenticated (Admin+) SQL Injections"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the 's' and 'status' parameters in versions up to, and including, 4.0.3 due to insufficient escaping on the user-supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated Admin+ attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."
