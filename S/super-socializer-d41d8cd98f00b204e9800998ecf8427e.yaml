  name: "Social Share, Social Login and Social Comments <= 7.10.6 - Authentication Bypass"
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "The Social Share, Social Login and Social Comments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the 'the_champ_user_auth' AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 7.10.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, assuming they know their email address."
