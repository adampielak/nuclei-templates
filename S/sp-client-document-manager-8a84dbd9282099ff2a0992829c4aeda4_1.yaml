    SP Projects & Document Manager <= 2.6.0.0 - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The SP Projects & Document Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in versions up to, and including, 2.6.0.0 due to insufficient file type validation on the cdm_upload_file() function. This makes it possible for attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
