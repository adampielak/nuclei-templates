  name: SSRF in Next.js Image Optimization Component
  author: ayushkr12
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Next.js's `_next/image` component can be exploited to perform SSRF attacks if improperly configured.
    This allows attackers to make arbitrary requests from the server, potentially leaking sensitive information or causing denial of service.
  remediation: |
    Define allowed image sources in `next.config.js` using the `domains` option to prevent arbitrary requests.
