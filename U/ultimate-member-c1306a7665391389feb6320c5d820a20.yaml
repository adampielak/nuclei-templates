    Ultimate Member <= 2.0.45 - Low-Privileged Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via an uploaded file's name from a user profile upload in versions up to, and including, 2.0.45 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for low-level authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
