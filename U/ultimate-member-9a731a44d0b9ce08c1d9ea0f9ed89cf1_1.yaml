    Ultimate Member â€“ User Profile, Registration, Login, Member Directory, Content Restriction & Membership Plugin <= 2.6.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the admin_init function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke select functions using the 'um_admin_do_action__' hook via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
