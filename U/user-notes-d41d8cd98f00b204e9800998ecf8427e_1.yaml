  name: "User Notes <= 1.0.1 - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The User Notes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 1.0.1, due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'user_notes_note' parameter. This makes it possible for users with access to add user notes to inject malicious web scripts that could execute whenever a victim accesses a user's profile page."
