  name: "Welcart e-Commerce <= 2.8.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.8.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke them and execute actions on behalf of administrators, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
