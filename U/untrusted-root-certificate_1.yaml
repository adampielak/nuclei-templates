  description: |
     A root certificate is a digital certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority that acts as a basis for other digital certificates. An untrusted root certificate is a certificate that is issued by an authority that is not trusted by the computer, and therefore cannot be used to authenticate websites or other digital certificates.
