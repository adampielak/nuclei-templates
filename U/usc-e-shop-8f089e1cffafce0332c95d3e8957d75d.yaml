    Welcart e-Commerce <= 2.9.5 - Authenticated (Administrator+) PHP Object Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Welcart e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to 2.9.5 (inclusive) via deserialization of untrusted input in the welcart_confirm_check_ajax function. This makes it possible for administrators to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.
