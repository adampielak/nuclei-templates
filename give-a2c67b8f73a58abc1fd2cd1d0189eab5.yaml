  name: "GiveWP <= 2.25.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The GiveWP for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.25.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the give_donation_import_callback function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to process the import of donations via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
