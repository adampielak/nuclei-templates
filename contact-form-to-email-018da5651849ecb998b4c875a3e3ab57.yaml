    Contact Form Email <= 1.3.11 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Contact Form Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.11. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'cp_cfte_rep_enable' action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings and inject malicious JavaScript via the 'cp_cfte_rep_message' parameter (in versions less than or equal to 1.1.4) via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
