    Attorney <= 3 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Content Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Attorney theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the hd_delete_index_page function hooked via admin_init in versions up to, and including, 3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary posts and content via the 'drop' parameter.
