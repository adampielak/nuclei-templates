  name: "Download Monitor <= 4.7.51 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Data Export"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Download Monitor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several REST-API routes related to reporting in versions up to, and including, 4.7.51. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view user data and other sensitive information intended for administrators."
