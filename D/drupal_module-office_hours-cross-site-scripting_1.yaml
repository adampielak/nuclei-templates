  description: "This module enables you to define a weekly office hours field type, and add a field to any Content type, in order to display the weekly opening hours for a location. The module doesnt sufficiently filter user-supplied text leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker needs additional permissions. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with a role with the permission administer display regardless of other configurations. In some scenarios, the vulnerability can be exploited by a user with Create content or Edit content for a relevant Content type."
