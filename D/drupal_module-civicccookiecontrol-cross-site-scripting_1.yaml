  description: "CivicCookieControl is a module that can help make a website compliant with EU and UK cookie legislation. The Civic GovUK Cookie Control module does not sufficiently sanitize the configuration resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must have a role with the Administer Civic Cookie Control permission."
