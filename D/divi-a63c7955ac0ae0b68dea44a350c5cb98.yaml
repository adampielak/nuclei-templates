    Elegant Themes (Various Versions) - Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Elegant Themes Divi Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.17.2 in addition to the following themes: Divi <= 3.17.2 and Extra <= 2.17.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the post builder. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
