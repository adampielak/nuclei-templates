  description: "Doubleclick for Publishers (DFP) module enables a site to place ads from Doubleclick For Publishers. The module doesnt sanitize user input in certain cases, which leads to Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. An attacker that can create or edit certain entities may be able to exploit a Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerability to target visitors of the site, including site admins with privileged access. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission administer DFP."
