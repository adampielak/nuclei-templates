  description: "This module enables you to extract the textual content of files for use on a website, e.g. to display it or use it in search indexes. The module doesnt sufficiently protect the administrator-defined commands that are executed on the server, which leads to post-authentication remote code execution by a limited set of users. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission administer search_api. Sites are encouraged to review which roles have that permission and which users have that role, to ensure that only trusted users have that permission."
