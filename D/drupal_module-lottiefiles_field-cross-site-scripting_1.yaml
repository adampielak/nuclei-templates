  description: "The Lottiefiles Field module enables you to integrate the lottiefiles features into your page. The module does not sufficiently filter user-provided text on output, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the permission to create or edit content that has lottiefiles fields."
