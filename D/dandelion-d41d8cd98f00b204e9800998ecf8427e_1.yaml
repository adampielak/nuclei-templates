info:
  name: "Dendelion < 2.6.6 - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The Dendelion theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the upload-handler.php file in versions before 2.6.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
