id: CVE-2022-4023

info:
  name: "3DPrint <= 3.5.6.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Download"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The 3DPrint plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.5.6.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the tinyfilemanager.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create a backup of any file or directory on the site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. File backups are stored with a predictable name (prepending a timestamp) in a known location which adds a trivial amount of complexity."
