  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Thrive Theme Builder theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.20.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the affected function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
