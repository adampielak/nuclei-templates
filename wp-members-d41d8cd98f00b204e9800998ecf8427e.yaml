  name: "WP-Members Membership Plugin <= 2.8.9 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WP Members plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Multiple Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions before 2.8.10 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser."
