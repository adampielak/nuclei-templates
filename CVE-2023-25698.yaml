info:
  name: "Shoppable Images <= 1.2.3 - Cross Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Shoppable Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions used to manipulate images. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform image manipulation tasks such as deletion, and delete arbitrary posts, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
