  name: "StudioZen Theme (All Versions) - Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The StudioZen Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of jPlayer in all known versions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
