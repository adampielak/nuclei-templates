id: CVE-2022-2436

info:
  name: "Download Manager <= 3.2.49 - Authenticated (Contributor+) PHAR Deserialization"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'file[package_dir]' parameter in versions up to, and including 3.2.49. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor privileges and above to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload."
