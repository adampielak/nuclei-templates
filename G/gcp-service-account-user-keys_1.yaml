  name: User-Managed Service Account Keys Found
  author: princechaddha
  severity: medium
  description: |
    Ensure that your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) user-managed service accounts are using GCP-managed keys instead of user-managed keys for authentication. For user-managed key pairs, key management operations such as key storage, key distribution, key revocation, key recovery, and key rotation, as well as key protection against unauthorized access, are your responsibilities.
  impact: |
    Using user-managed keys can lead to potential security risks such as unauthorized access if keys are not properly managed and secured.
  remediation: |
    Transition to using GCP-managed keys for service accounts to ensure key management is handled by Google Cloud, thereby enhancing security and reducing the administrative burden of manual key management.
