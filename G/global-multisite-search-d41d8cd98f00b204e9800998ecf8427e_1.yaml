  name: "Global Multisite Search <= 1.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Global Multisite Search plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpgms_ajax_result_function function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to query and read content from multiple sites via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
