    GiveWP <= 2.25.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via save
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The GiveWP plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.25.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save' AJAX function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to import donations via forged request granted a CSV file containing those donations has been uploaded and they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
