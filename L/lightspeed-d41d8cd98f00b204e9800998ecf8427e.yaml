info:
  name: "Lightspeed <= 1.1.2 - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The Lightspeed theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via VALUMS_UPLOADER_PATH/php.php in versions up to, and including 1.1.2. This makes it possible for attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
