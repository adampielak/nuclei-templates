    Post Lockdown <= 4.0.2 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Post Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Post Lockdown plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.2 via the 'pl_autocomplete' AJAX action due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to extract data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.
