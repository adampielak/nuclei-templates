  name: "Plugin for Google Reviews <= 2.2.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Plugin for Google Reviews for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create widgets, via forged request granted they can trick a site user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
