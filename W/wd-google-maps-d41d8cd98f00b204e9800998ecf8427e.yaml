  name: "10WebMapBuilder <= 1.0.63 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Plugin Settings Change"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The 10WebMapBuilder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Plugin Settings Change in versions up to, and including, 1.0.63 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping and a lack of capability checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
