  name: "Advanced Shipment Tracking for WooCommerce <= 3.2.6 - Authenticated WordPress Options Change"
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "The function update_shipment_status_email_status_fun in the plugin Advanced Shipment Tracking for WooCommerce in versions up to 3.2.6 is vulnerable to authenticated arbitrary options update. The function allows attackers (including those at customer level) to update any WordPress option in the database. Version 3.2.5 was initially released as a fix, but doesn't fully address the issue."
