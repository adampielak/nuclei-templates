  name: "Shopping Cart & eCommerce Store <= 5.2.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WP Easycart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.2.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'wp-easycart-submit-newsletter' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unknown action granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The impact of this vulnerability is unknown."
