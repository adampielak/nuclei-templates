    WooCommerce <= 3.6.4 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request forgery in versions up to, and including 3.6.4, due to the CSV importer actions missing a nonce validation.  This makes it possible for attackers with at least author privileges to embed script code in a CSV, upload it to the target site, and then trick an administrator into uploading the CSV injected payload to a product description via a forged request all granted they can trick them into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
