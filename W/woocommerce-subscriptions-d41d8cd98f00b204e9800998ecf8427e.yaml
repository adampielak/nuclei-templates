  name: "WooCommerce Subscriptions <= 3.0.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.0.2. This is due to incorrect nonce validation on the view-subscription functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify any user's subscription status via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
