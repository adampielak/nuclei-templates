  name: "WooCommerce Blocks <= 3.7.0 - Authorization Bypass"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WooCommerce Blocks plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.7.0. This is due to insufficient validation on the account creation processes during checkout. This makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker to register an account on WooCommerce sites even when the setting to enable account creation was not active."
