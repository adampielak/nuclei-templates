  name: "Dropshipping and affiliates for Amazon and woocommerce <= 1.4.3 - Missing Authorization"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Dropshipping and affiliates for Amazon and woocommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on several functions called via nopriv AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 1.4.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify data stored on the site, such as products."
