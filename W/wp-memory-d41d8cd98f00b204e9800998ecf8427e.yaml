  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Memory Usage, Memory Limit, PHP and Server Memory Health Check plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 2.43  due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
