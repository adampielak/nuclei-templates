  name: "WooCommerce Product Carousel, Slider & Grid Ultimate <= 1.8.6 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WooCommerce Product Carousel, Slider & Grid Ultimate plugin for WordPress, versions up to and including 1.8.6, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The script /includes/carousel.php (as well as other setting-related scripts) does not sanitize user input. This allows a lower-level user (contributor and higher) to insert JavaScript into the database."
