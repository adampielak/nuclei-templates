    WordPress Core < 6.0.3 - Authenticated (Editor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Comments
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    WordPress Core is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting, exploitable during comment editing, in versions up to 6.0.3. This is due to insufficient escaping and sanitization on the values being stored during a comment update. This makes it possible for authenticated users with high level permissions, such as an editor, to modify post comments to include malicious web scripts that will execute whenever someone accesses the comment.
