  name: "Woo MerchantX <= 1.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Woo MerchantX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'merchantx_stepOne_addBilling', 'merchantx_stepOne' and 'merchantx_deletePaymentMethod' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain restricted access to administrative actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
