  name: "Feed Them Social <= 4.0.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Feed Them Social plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.0.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_meta_box function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
