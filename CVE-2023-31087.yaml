id: CVE-2023-31087

info:
  name: "JS Job Manager <= 2.0.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via multiple functions"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The JS Job Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a large number of functions in the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make use of nearly all the administrative functionality of the plugin via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
