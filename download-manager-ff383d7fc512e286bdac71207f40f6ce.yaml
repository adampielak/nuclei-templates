  name: "WordPress Download Manager < 3.1.19 - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WordPress Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the wpdm_admin_upload_file function in versions before 3.1.19. Dangerous extensions such as .php4 are not restricted. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Author-level privileges and above to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
