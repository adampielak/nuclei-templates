id: CVE-2022-43504

info:
  name: "WordPress Core < 6.0.3 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting via wp-mail.php"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "WordPress Core in versions up to 6.0.3 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting via wp-mail.php. This is due to no validation on what level the user was sending the email post and therefore did not perform any sanitization on the submitted post data. This meant that users without the unfiltered_html capability, with access to submitting posts via email, could inject malicious JavaScript into posts that would execute whenever someone accessed the post."
