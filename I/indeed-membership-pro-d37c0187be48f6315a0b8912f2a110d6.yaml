    Ultimate Membership Pro <= 8.6 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Ultimate Membership Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on an unknown function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create, modify, or delete user accounts, including accounts with administrative permissions, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
