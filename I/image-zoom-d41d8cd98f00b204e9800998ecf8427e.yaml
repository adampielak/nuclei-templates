  name: "Image Zoom <= 1.8.8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Image Zoom plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on all of the plugin's AJAX endpoints. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke the functions associated with them, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
