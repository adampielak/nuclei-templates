  name: "intimate Payments Plugin <= 1.3.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Intimate Payments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the handle_select_currency and handle_update_trx functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit transaction data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
