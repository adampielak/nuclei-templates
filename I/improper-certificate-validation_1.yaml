  name: Improper Certificate Validation
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: high
  description: |
    This template detects improper SSL/TLS certificate validation in Android applications. The use of methods such as `SslErrorHandler.proceed()` bypasses certificate validation, allowing attackers to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged between the app and its servers.
  remediation: |
    Replace `SslErrorHandler.proceed()` with proper validation logic or prompt the user when a certificate error occurs. Implement secure certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks and ensure that all certificates are properly validated.
