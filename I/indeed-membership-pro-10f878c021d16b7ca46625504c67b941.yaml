    Indeed Membership Pro <= 7.5 - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Indeed Membership Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the ajax-upload.php endpoint in versions up to, and including, 7.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.
