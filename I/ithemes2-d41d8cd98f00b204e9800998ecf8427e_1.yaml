  name: "iThemes2 < 1.4.3 - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The iThemes2 Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the themify-ajax.php file in versions up to 1.4.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
