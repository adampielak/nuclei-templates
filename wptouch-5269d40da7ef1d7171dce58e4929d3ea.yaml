    WPtouch <= 3.4.2 - Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WPtouch plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload in versions up to, and including, 3.4.2. This is due to the 'admin_initialize()' method being called by the 'admin_init' hook and a lack of capability checks on the function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to upload a backdoor, they can then use it to take complete control of the website.
