  severity: medium
  description: "The Formidable Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.5.6.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete form entries via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
