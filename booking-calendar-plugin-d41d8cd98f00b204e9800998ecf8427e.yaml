    Booking calendar, Appointment Booking System <= 3.2.8 - Multiple Authenticated(Editor+) SQL Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Booking calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the search functionality on multiple administrative pages in versions up to, and including, 3.2.8 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameters and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Editor privileges and above to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. Note that the Pro version of the plugin allows administrators to grant access to the plugin's Administrative pages to any user role, so other roles may be able to exploit the vulnerability if they have been granted access.
