    XML-RPC predates WordPress, it has been present in the b2 blogging software, which was then forked to create WordPress back in 2003. 
    XML-RPC was developed to enable communication between WordPress and other systems by standardizing those communications, using HTTP as the transport mechanism and XML as the datagram and encoding functionality.
    This functionality is still included with WordPress dispite the fact that XML-RPC is largely outdated. The xmlrpc.php file is typically stored in the root directory of the site.
