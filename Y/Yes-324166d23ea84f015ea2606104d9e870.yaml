  name: "WordPress Core < 6.0.3 - Shared User Instance Weakness"
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "WordPress Core in versions up to 6.0.3 had a weakness in how Share User Instances were handled. This fix appears to have been necessary to safely use the wp_set_current_user( 0 ); method to patch the previously mentioned XSS and CSRF in wp-mail.php and wp-trackback.php vulnerabilities. The previous functionality may have resulted in third party plugins or themes using the wp_set_current_user function in a way that could lead to privilege escalation and users being able to perform more actions than originally intended."
