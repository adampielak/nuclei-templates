  name: "YITH WooCommerce Wishlist <= 2.1.2 - SQL Injection"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The YITH WooCommerce Wishlist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'limit' variable in versions up to, and including, 2.1.2 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber level permissions and above to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."
