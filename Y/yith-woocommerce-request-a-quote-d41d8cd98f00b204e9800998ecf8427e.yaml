info:
  name: "YITH Request a Quote for WooCommerce <= 1.6.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The YITH Request a Quote for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add and edit items to a session quote via a forged request granted they can trick a site user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
