id: CVE-2020-35489

info:
  name: "Contact Form 7 <= 5.3.1 - Arbitrary File Upload via Bypass"
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: "The Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in versions up to 5.3.2. This is due to the fact that the plugin allows filenames to contain special characters which may make extension filter evasion possible on certain configurations. Our team was not able to reproduce this issue which leads us to believe there is a high attack complexity or special configuration requirement."
