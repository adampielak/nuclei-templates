    Zephyr Project Manager <= 3.2.42 - Missing Authorization to Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Zephyr Project Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check and lack of authentication/authorization on its REST endpoints in versions up to, and including, 3.2.42. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to utilize them. Additionally, user input is not properly sanitized leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting.
