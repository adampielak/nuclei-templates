    WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System <= 7.1.4 - Authentication Bypass
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions up to, and including, 7.1.4. This is due to the plugin only requiring a valid email for the loginGuestFacebook AJAX action which is passed to the wp_set_auth_cookie() function and will log the user in as the account associated with the supplied email. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any users account, including administrators.
