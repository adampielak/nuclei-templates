id: CVE-2023-23978

info:
  name: "WP Client Reports <= 1.0.16 - Missing Authorization to Sensitive Information Exposure"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The WP Client Reports plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 1.0.16 via the wp_client_reports_send_email_report_from_ajax() function due to a missing capability check. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to extract sensitive data, including information stored in client reports. Please note that this still appears to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery."
