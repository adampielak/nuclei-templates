  name: "Fruitful < 3.8.2 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Fruitful Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters stored via the fruitful_theme_options_action AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 3.8.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
