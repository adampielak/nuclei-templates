  name: "FormBuilder < 1.08 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The FormBuilder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions before 1.08. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save settings function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change permission settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
