  name: "Woocommerce Tabs Plugin, Add Custom Product Tabs <= 1.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Woocommerce Tabs Plugin, Add Custom Product Tabs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit session information via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
