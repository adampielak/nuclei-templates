  name: "FLV Embed <= 1.2.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Options Update"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The FLV Embed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the flv_sitemap_options_panel function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin settings via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
