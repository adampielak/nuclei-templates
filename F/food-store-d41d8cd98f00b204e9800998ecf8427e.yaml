  name: "Food Store < 1.3.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Food Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions before 1.3.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make unauthorized AJAX calls to perform arbitrary actions via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
