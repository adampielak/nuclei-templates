  name: >
    Backup, Restore and Migrate WordPress Sites With the XCloner Plugin 4.2.1 - 4.2.12 - Unprotected AJAX Actions
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    An issue was discovered in the XCloner Backup and Restore plugin before 4.2.13 for WordPress. It gave authenticated attackers the ability to modify arbitrary files, including PHP files. Doing so would allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution. The xcloner_restore.php write_file_action could overwrite wp-config.php, for example. Alternatively, an attacker could create an exploit chain to obtain a database dump.
