  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WP Security Question plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.5.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
